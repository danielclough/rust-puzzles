# rust-puzzles

My implementation of Hacker Rank puzzles in rust.

## Motivation
I've spent about 2 weeks reading the first half of [The Rust Programing Language]() and doing [Rustlings]().

After having completed the CLI App tutorial in the book I want to play with the language some.

This problem set is basically my notes while working through some Hacker Rank Problems in Rust.

> **Do not copy my code while doing Hacker Rank problems!**
> 
> The purpose of Hacker Rank is to showcase your skills.
> They have a copy of all of my code and **will catch you if you are cheating.**

Each problem sets up the environment described in a hacker rank puzzle, and I use this to test my code, then I copy/paste my function into Hacker Rank.

The name of each problem, as well as the input and output, are the same as Hacker Rank.
But, Hacker Rank implents the setup for each problem on their backend and in the browser, so obviously my setup will be quite different. 

## Use 

### CLI path
eg: `cargo run input/week1/plus_minus.txt`

### Example .env
```
CURRENT_WEEK="week1"
CURRENT_FILE="plus_minus.txt"
```
